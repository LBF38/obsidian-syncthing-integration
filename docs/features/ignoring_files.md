# Ignoring files from  synchronization

The plugin simplifies the way to ignore a file from synchronization with Syncthing.

The mechanism provided by Syncthing is by creating a special file named `.stignore`.
As those kind of files are ignored and not visible in Obsidian, the plugin allows you to manage ignored files in the plugin's settings.

For doing this, you can use the following setting, see below for an example.
